## My Process:

I developed the project over the course of approximately A week and a half. In order to learn as much as I can from the development of this project, I implemented certain features from scratch including accessible and scrollable tabs, a carousel functionality, and infinite loading.

### Tools.

After designing a prototype of the application using Adobe XD, I started developing the app using the following technologies:

- Vue.js. 
- javascript.

- SCSS modules (CSS grid & CSS Flexbox & Media queries)
- Vue router, Font Awesome (Icons)
